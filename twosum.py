## use hash map to instantly check for difference value, map will add index of last occurrence of a num, donâ€™t use same element twice;
## We iterate through the array and calculate if the { target  - current value } is already in the hashmap
## If it's already in the hashmap, we return the indices and solution is complete.
## Time complexity at worst is 0(n)
